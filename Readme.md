# Fractal-Generation-in-Parallel-with-MPI

## About
This project explores generating fractals, specifically the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, by using the parallel programming practices. Using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), the aim is to efficiently generate complex fractals through distributed computing.

Fractals are intricate mathematical patterns that exhibit self-similarity and infinite detail and as you can imagine as the pixel size increases the more slower and computationally intensive it becomes to generate these fractals. The implementation of MPI enables the decomposition of computational tasks across multiple processes, significantly enhancing performance and scalability. By distributing the workload, this project demonstrates the potential of parallel programming in handling computationally intensive tasks.
